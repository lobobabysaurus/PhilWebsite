I'm not a very big fan of writing.  It makes me feel anxious to know that people
can publicly see my creative output.  That being said I think its important to
challenge oneself and to expand your skills and horizons.  
To that end I've decided to take on a big challenge for myself.
To start writing, to make it available, and to try to come up with things
interesting enough to be worth reading.
